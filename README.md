## Summary

### Why I built this project:
- To provide the client an application that'll allow them to display their products as well as provide them a system that allows them to freely create, modify, and delete meals without having to build a completely new website.


### What was the focus of the project:
- Create a content managing system that is explicit and easy to use. 
- Implement a global state that tracks the user's "Bag" state.
- Complete the project within the timeframe the client asked for.


### How this project is built:
- Redux is used to keep track of the global state such as the user's bag, the appearance of a modal, the presence of the admin user, and the user's current session.
- Page routes are managed using React Router.
- The page folders are organized similar to Next.js structure.
- Customer orders, business open dates, and meal information are recorded in MongoDB.
- REST API routes are created using Node and Express.
- Meal Images are hosted through Firebase.
- REST API is hosted through Heroku.
- Client is hosted through Netlify.

### Reflection
- Working on this project not only allowed me to exercise my backend skills, but I was also able to work with time constraints. Knowing that there was a deadline, helped with figuring out a task list. 
- If I were to make this project better, I would experiment with using MongoDB and GridFS to potentially replace Firebase, incorporate animation throughout the application, and more personality to the design itself.
